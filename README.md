## My process

### Built with

- No JavaScript
- Desktop first
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The content needs to be in the same div as the radio button to be able to be targeted with :checked.  
The content needs to a sibling or descendant.  

### Continued development

- Semantic HTML.
- Web Accessibility.
- Have to check various screen sizes since absolute positioning was used.
- Only allowed one question open at a time.
